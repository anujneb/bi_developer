Solutions should be submitted by returning a GitHub repo url containing the files.

A. Given the subset of DoneDeal's schema below, write executable SQL queries to answer the following:

  1. Determine the number of active ads on the site per day (use generate_series).
  2. Determine the YoY growth of Beef Cattle ads in county Tipperary from 2016 to 2017 (use lag).

Please answer in a single query for each question and assume read-only access to the database (ie. do not use CREATE TABLE).

Assume a PostgreSQL database, server timezone is GMT
